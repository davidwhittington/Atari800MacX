# fuji-dynasty

The feature-rich, modular version of fuji-foundation. Additional capabilities are added
as opt-in modules on top of the core.

**Status:** Scaffold — derived from fuji-foundation, module architecture in progress.

## Relation to fuji-foundation

fuji-dynasty is derived from fuji-foundation (Atari800MacOS core) and extends it with
optional modules. Each module is self-contained and can be enabled/disabled independently.

## Upstream Tracking

Upstream core changes flow through fuji-foundation first.
See `../fuji-foundation` for upstream integration notes.
